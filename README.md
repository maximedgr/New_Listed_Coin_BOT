# New Coin Listed - BOT Telegram
This project offers you to host a telegram bot detecting the new coins listed on different chains: Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Polygon, BSC...

You can host it directly on your machine or on a remote server to receive notifications at any time through the Telegram messaging application.

This bot uses the Coingecko listings that I recommend you to check: https://www.coingecko.com/en/new-cryptocurrencies
